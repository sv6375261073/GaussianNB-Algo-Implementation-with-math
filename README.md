# GaussianNB-Algo-Implementation-with-math
This is a classifier based on probablity of samles it find the most closet value of a sample by calulating probablity
this algo is best to classify classes having best performence 
based on gaussian probablistic function
having max probablity with the class means sample more closet to the max probablitic class
